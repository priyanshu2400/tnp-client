# TNP-Client Repository

This repository contains the client-side code for the Training and Placement Portal (TNP). It is a single-page application (SPA) built using React and Redux, with a user-friendly interface styled using Material UI. The client-side application communicates with the backend server to provide various features for students and administrators.

## Backend Repository
